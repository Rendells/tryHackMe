Networks are simply things connected. For example, your friendship circle: you are all connected becasuse of similar interest, hobbies, skills and sorts.
Networks can be found in all walks of life:

A city's public transportation system
Infrastructure such as the national power grid for electricity
Meeting and greeting your neighbours
Postal systems for sending letters and parcels

Networks are integrated into our everyday life. Be it gathering data for the weather, delivering electricity to homes or even determining who has the right of way at a road. 
Because networks are so embedded in the modern-day, networking is an essential concept to grasp in cybersecurity.

MAC address
 - Decice on a network will all have a physical network interface, whihc is a microchip board found on the device's motherboard. 
This network interfface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, called a MAC (Media Access Control) address. The MAC address is a sixteen-character hexadecimal number(a base
sixteen numbering ststem used in computing to represent numbers) split into two's and separated by a colon, for example 14:c3:F0:95:ac:2s.
The firs six characters repesent the company that made the network interface, and the last six is a unique number.
[MAC address can be faked or "spoofed"] 

What is the key term for devices that are connected together?

 - Internet Protocol

What is each section of an IP address called?
 - Octet

How many sections (in digits) does an IP address have?

What is the Internet?
The Internet is one giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself. 
Using our example from the previous task, lets now imagine that Alice made some new friends named Zayon and Toby that she wants to introduce to Bob and Jim.
The problem is that Alice is the onlu person who speaks the same language as Zayn and Toby.

As previously stated, the Internet is made up of many small networks all joined together. 
These small networks are called private networks, where networks connecting these small networks are called public networks -- or the Internet! So, to recap, a network can be one of two types:
A private network
A public network

Who invented the World Wide Web?
