Incident Responder
 - Inceident responder responds productively and effiently to security breaches. Responsibilities include creating plans, policies, and protocols for ogranisations to enact during and following incidents.
This often a high pressurised position with assessments and responses required in real-time, as attacks are unfolding.
Responsibilities
Developing and adopting a thorough, actionable incident response plan
Maintaining strong security best practices and supporting incident response measures
Post-incident reporting and preparation for future attacks, considering learnings and adaptations to take from incidents

Digital Forensics Examiner
 - If you like to play detective, this might be the perfect job. If you are working as part of a law-enforcement department, you would be focused on collecting and analysing evidence to help solbe crimes:
Charging the guilty and exonerating the innocent. n the other hand, if your work falls under defending a company's network, you will be using your forensic skills to analyse incidents, such as policy violations.
Responsibilities
Collect digital evidence while observing legal procedures
Analyse digital evidence to find answers related to the case
Document your findings and report on the case


Malware Analyst - Analyses all types of malware to learn more about how they work and what they do
A malware analyst's work involves analysing suspicious programs, discovering what they do and writing reports about their findings. 
A malware analyst is sometimes called a reverse-engineer as their core task revolves around converting compiled programs from machine language to readable code, usually in a low-level language. 
This work requires the malware analyst to have a strong programming background, especially in low-level languages such as assembly language and C language. The ultimate goal is to learn about all the activities that a malicious program carries out, find out how to detect it and report it.

Responsibilities
Carry out static analysis of malicious programs, which entails reverse-engineering
Conduct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled environment
Document and report all the findings


Penetration Tester - Responsible for testing technology products for security loopholes
 - You may see penetration testing referred to as pentesting and ethical hacking. 
A penetration tester's job role is to test the security of the systems and software within a company - this is achieved through attempts to uncover flaws and vulnerabilities through systemised hacking. 
Penetration testers exploit these vulnerabilities to evaluate the risk in each instance. The company can then take these insights to rectify issues to prevent a real-world cyberattack.

Responsibilities
Conduct tests on computer systems, networks, and web-based applications
Perform security assessments, audits, and analyse policies
Evaluate and report on insights, recommending actions for attack prevention

Red Teamer - Plays the role of an adversary, attacking an organisation and providing feedback from an enemies perspective- 
- Red teamers share similarities to penetration testers, with a more targeted job role. 
Penetration testers look to uncover many vulnerabilities across systems to keep cyber-defence in good standing, whilst red teamers are enacted to test the company's detection and response capabilities. 
This job role requires imitating cyber criminals' actions, emulating malicious attacks, retaining access, and avoiding detection. Red team assessments can run for up to a month, typically by a team external to the company. 
They are often best suited to organisations with mature security programs in place

Responsibilities
Emulate the role of a threat actor to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, maintain access and avoid detection
Assess organisations' security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures
Evaluate and report on insights, with actionable data for companies to avoid real-world instances
