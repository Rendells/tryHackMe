What is penetration testing?
Before teaching you the technical hands-on aspects of ethical hacking, you'll need to understand more about what a penetration tester's job responsibilities are and what processes are followed in performing pentests (finding vulnerabilities in a clients application or system).
The importance and relevancy of cybersecuity are ever-increasing and can be in eveery walk of life. News headlines fill our screens, yet another hack or data leak.
Cybersecurity is relevant to all people in the modern world, including a strong password policy to protect your emails or to buinesses and other organizations needed to protect bnoth devices and data from damages.
A Penetration test or pentest is an ethicalluy-drivern attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pices of information. A penetration test involves usin the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an adult

PENETRATION TESTING ETHICS
The battle of legality and ethics in cybersecurity, let alone peentration testing is aleays controversial. Labels like "hackking" and "hacker" often hold negative connotations, especiallu in pop culture, thanks to a few bad people.
The idea of legally gaining access to a computer system is a challenging concept to grasp -- after all, what makes it legal exactly.
Recall that penetration test is authorised audit of a computer system's security and defences as agreed by the owners of the systems. 
Before a pentration test starts, a formal discussion occurs between the penetration tester and the system owener. Various tools, texhniques, and systems to be tested are agreeed on. This discussion form the scope of the penetration testing agreeement .
Companies that provide penetration testing services are held against legal frameworks and industry accreditation. 
For example, the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) has the CHECK accreditation scheme in the UK. This check means that onl "[CHECK] approved companies can conduct authorised penetration tes of public sector and CNI systems and networks." (NCSC)
Ethics is the moral debate between right and wrong; where an action may be legal, it may go against an individual's belief system of right and wrong.

WHITE HAT - These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.
(For example, a penetration tester performing an authorised engaement on a company.)
GREY HAT - These people use their skills to benefit other oftern; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.
(For example, someone taking down a scammin site)
BLACK HAT - These people are ciminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.
(For example, ransomeware authors infect devices with malicious code and hold data for ransom.)

Rules of Engagement (ROE)
The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement.
This doucment consits of three main sections, which are ultimately responible for deciding how the engagement is carried out. The SANS institure has a freat example of this document which can view.

PERMISSION - This seciton of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations.
TEST SCOPE - This sections of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagemnent should apply. For example, the penetration test may onlly applyjj to cetain servers
RULES - The rules section will define exactly the techinques that are permitted during the engagement. Fore example, the rulesss may sepcifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohinited, but MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks are okay.

You are given permission to perform a security audit on an organisation; what type of hacker would you be?
- white hat
You attack an organisation and steal their data, what type of hacker would you be?
- black hat
